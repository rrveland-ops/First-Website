<h1> Airplane Specsüìó</h1>
<p>EF1989 Glasair II FT (Fixed Tricycle Gear) </p>

<P>Engine: 150 hp Lycoming O-320 E2D</P>

<p>TTAF: 1292</p>
<p>TACH: 1292</p>
<p>Original engine </p> 

<p></p>Compressions June 2024: 76/75/80/77//80 

<p></p> Electronic Mags & Digital Engine Monitoring

<p></p>Prop: Prince Carbon Fiber 'P' Tip installed 2006

<p></p> Avionics: 
<p></p>ADS-B: uAvionix Skybeacon TSO Nav Strobe Light / ADS-B Out

<p></p>Avionics/Radios: 7" Dynon HDX (PFD, GPS, & Engine Monitor) UAvionix EchoUAT ADSB In & Out, Narco 810 Com, Narco AT150 Transponder, Two Place Intercom.

<p></p>Useful load: 629.1 lbs. Long wing tips (wingspan 27 ft), Manual Trim & Flaps, Equipped for Day & Night VFR w/ LED Nav Lights.

<p></p>Never involved in an accident/ no damage history. 

<p></p>Stall speed, in lading configuration, is like a Cessna. Manufacturer recommended speed for final is 80 mph. I do agree with the typical insurance requirement of 10 hours of transition training. It is a slippery, fast plane. However, once you get the feel for it, my airline buddy commented it is similar to flying a training Diamond. I agree with him.  
Delivery to your airport available (USA, ‚Äúlower 48‚Äù).  

<P></P>Sad to see it go, but needing to focus on business & family, so I just don't have time to fly / travel.  As such it has a few squawks I haven't gotten to: 

<p></p>1. Hobbs is not working
<p></p>2. Passenger door seal needs to be replaced. Airflow through it makes an annoying high pitched sound.  
<p></p>3. Wing fuel cap could be replaced. If not seated correctly, it leaks during flight. 

<p></p>Price is firm: Fast, fuel efficient, & based on current comparable listings/sales (many of which $100k) N163SR is a great value at $71,000
